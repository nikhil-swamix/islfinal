                      <p>
                        Electrical engineering is a field of engineering that
                        generally deals with the study and application of
                        electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism. This
                        field first became an identifiable occupation in the
                        later half of the 19th century after commercialization
                        of the electric telegraph, the telephone, and electric
                        power distribution and use. Subsequently, broadcasting
                        and recording media made electronics part of daily life.
                        The invention of the transistor, and later the
                        integrated circuit, brought down the cost of electronics
                        to the point they can be used in almost any household
                        object.
